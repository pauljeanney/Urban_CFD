# 🏙️ Urban_CFD – CFD Simulations with Scalar Transport

Welcome to **Urban_CFD**! 🌬️🌆  
This repository contains a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation project using **OpenFOAM** focused on urban environments.

It features:

🌀 **simpleFoam-based simulation** using the **SF** (steady-state) solver.
🌫️ A custom scalar transport solver called **simpleConlyFoam** – designed for simulating **air pollution dispersion** in urban areas.
🏙️ Tailored for **urban CFD applications** like pollutant spread in cityscapes.
