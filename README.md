# 🏙️ Urban_CFD – CFD Simulations + air pollution scalar transport.

This repository contains a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation project using **OpenFOAM** focused on urban environments.

It features:

🌀 **simpleFoam-based simulation** using the **SF** (steady-state) solver.

🌫️ A custom scalar transport solver called **simpleConlyFoam** using the **SCF** file – designed for simulating **air pollution dispersion** in urban areas.
